Make a product that decreases the ping of games.

## About this project:
The project has purpose of I apply news concepts that learned about Web Accessibility, methodology BEM, improve Js animations and form validation with RegExp at Alura courses.
The Design, HTML5 semantics and code was thought to make a application accessible all peoples.
I applied the BEM methodology in the CSS3 code structure for testing and see if the code organization is better, as a result I liked this method! I will insert in the next projects.

## Technologies and Tools:
* HTML5;
* CSS3:
  * BEM;
